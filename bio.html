        <p style="padding-left:1005px; padding-top: 50px; color:white">I was entered to Pre-Kinder in Palm Lane Early due to my birthday. I later proved that I was capable of performing advanced tasks, and I was moved to kinder in Patrick Henry Elementary School ; later moving to Abraham Lincoln Elementary School where I entered the DLA program in kinder as well, turning 6 in first Grade and finishing at 6 turing 7 in sencond Grade, and so on until 6th Grade. While in 6th Grade COVID-19 made us go into a pandemic and making classes partake on online learning due to the social distancing regime, learning became extremely hard for me due to not being able to socialize and not having physical ways to ask for help - I got really lonely, though I would spend much time with my close family that lived together at the time - I turned 12 in seventh grade, where everything was online for the whole year; seventh grade was a hard year due to me not doing any work and only playing games during class, I got one bad grade that year surprisingly. Eighth grade was in person with a mask mandate that made me feel a whole lot better due to me being able to have friends and experience middle school for the first time. The mask mandate got lifted in 9th grade where I had my transitioning stage and was really awkward, and I didn't talk to people. 10th Grade has been good so far and I think it is the most I have grown as a person in the past almost 15 years of my life. </p>
        <p style="padding-left:1005px; padding-top: 50px; color: white">I learned about computer science in 4th grade; I always had a way with technology and I learned things fast (as long as I put myself to it) computer science has been on my mind ever since. I always dreamt about being a developer and programer professionally, I still do. Some of my dream schools to go to are:</p>

        <h3>Plans:</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">In my life I would like to be able to graduate as valedictorian and be accepted by all of my dream and the top schools. I would also like to work hard so that I can make some really good projects whlie in college, I would also like to graduate college at the top of my class as well. Once out of college I would like to apply my career and be able to create my own technology company and be able to make some games, music and other things that I enjoy doing.</p>
        <p style="border:2px; color: white;width:1380px; border-radius:2px;">In the future I plan to hopefully succeed with a technology company, I will hire my friends and family first to have a base to start with expand. I would also like to make the world cleaner and safer using technology.</p>
